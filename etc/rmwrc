# rmw will not ReMove files to this folder if it's on the same filesystem
# as the folder used above.
# But it will check for files ready to be purged if it's uncommented.

# If you would like this to be your primary trash folder (i.e. tied to
# your Desktop Trash), be sure it's listed at the top, before other
# WASTE folders.
